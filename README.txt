What I added: 

1.) I changed the flighttimes array list to a tree map to be able to add the duration of the destination conveniently when reading from the flight.txt file. 

2.) I changed the flights arraylist to a tree map as needed and updated the methods in flight manager to able to use the tree map.

3.) I added two more exceptions called FlightNotFound and FlightIsFull that help throwing an exception when the flight is not found or when flight is full.

4.) In flight, I added three methods that help me create the seat layout which are "getRows()", "getColumns()" and "GetColumnsFCL()".

5.) I added a seat layout method in aircraft to create the the layout needed to print the seats in the appropriate formatting shown by the video.
